Rembert Montald's Sketching the figure class.

![BASICS](assets/basics_sketching_the_figure.jpeg)

In the basic course, Iâ€™ll teach drawing skills, movement, proportions of the mannequin, posing, anatomy etc.

In the advance class, we will do more finished sketches from imagination without reference like these ones.
